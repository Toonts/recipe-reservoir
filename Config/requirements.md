# Vision

The vision for Recipe Reservoir is to have an easy space to input and access recipes. This functionality allows for a consolidated place that users can keep their favorite digital and written recipes, search for recipes by titles or ingredients, and give recipes a rating. Everyone who cooks has favorite recipes, but doesn't always immediately know where to find it. With Recipe Reservoir, there is no more combing through Pinterest or your bookshelf to find that chocolate pizza recipe from Grandma.
